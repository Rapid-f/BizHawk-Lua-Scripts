# Rapid's BizHawk Lua Scripts
Lua scripts for BizHawk.

Lua has kick-started me into a hobby of programming, so don't expect this code to be too fancy!

## Games
This repository contains Lua scripts for the following games:

### The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening (DX)
These scripts should work on all versions of the game (the original, remake, as well as the localizations thereof).

- Sub-pixel Editor - A simple graphical user interface for editing & viewing Link's X and Y sub-pixel positions on the fly.
- Input Viewer - A graphical input viewer for those interested in making video content for demonstration purposes.
